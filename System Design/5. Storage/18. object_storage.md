**18. OBJECT STORAGE PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
- is an architecture that stores data as self-contained objects in a flat structure,
    * each containing the data, metadata, and a unique identifier. 
    * Key design principles include using APIs for access, a flat, non-hierarchical namespace, and mechanisms for scalability, durability, and security. 
    * These systems are built to manage vast amounts of unstructured data and are highly scalable, durable, and accessible. 
- Core components and principles
    * [Objects]: Each object is a container for data. It has three parts:
        1. [Data]:     
            - The actual content, such as an image, video, or document.
        2. [Metadata]: 
            - Customizable key-value pairs that describe the object, like content type, creation date, or user information.
        3. [Object-ID]: (or Key) 
            - A globally unique identifier used to retrieve the object via an API call.
    * [Flat-namespace]: 
        - Unlike traditional file systems that use a hierarchical directory structure
        - object storage uses a single, flat namespace. 
        - This simplifies management and improves scalability for massive datasets.
    * [APIs]: 
        - Interactions with the storage system are done through APIs.
        - typically RESTful HTTP-based interfaces.
        - This allows for standard, programmatic access and integration.
    * [Scalability]: 
        - To handle massive amounts of data
        - object storage decouples file management from low-level block management
        - often uses techniques like erasure coding or data replication across many machines and locations 
            * > to scale out storage capacity and performance.
    * [Durability-and-Availability]: 
        - Data is made highly durable and available by storing multiple copies or using erasure coding. 
        - This can include replicating data across different storage tiers, availability zones (different data centers)
        - or even different geographic regions.
    * [Security]: 
        - Access is controlled through policies, and data is protected via encryption both in transit and at rest. 
        - Features like S3 Object Lock can also enforce immutability for ransomware protection.
- How it works in practice
    1. [Upload]:
        - A client sends a request to upload data, often using a pre-signed URL. 
        - For large files, the client may upload the data in smaller chunks, a process called multi-part upload
            * > which are then reassembled by the system once all parts are received.
    2. [Processing]: 
        - The system receives the data and its metadata, generates a unique object ID
        - stores the object in a flat structure, possibly across multiple storage nodes.
    3. [Retrieval]: 
        - To retrieve the object, the client sends a GET request using the object's unique ID to the API.
        - The system then fetches and returns the object.
    4. [Modification]: 
        - Modifying an object is typically done by deleting the old version and uploading a new one
            * > as objects are generally immutable. 

**18. OBJECT STORAGE PART 2**
------------------------------------------------------------
- Database specifically for large files (collection of bytes)
    * Binary Large Objects (BLOBS)
        * > Videos 
        * > Photos
        * > JSON files
        * > Large text files
    * Normal databases are built for small frequently changing records that need rich queries and joins.
        * > Not made to handle large mostly static files like the ones above.
        * > choke on blobs in terms of performance and terms of cost.
