**16. REPLICATION & SHARDING PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
1. `database-sharding`
    - helps handle large data volumes by splitting data across multiple servers, but it adds complexity, especially for cross-shard queries.
    - is a database scaling technique where data is partitioned across multiple servers or databases, known as shards.
        * > Each shard holds a subset of the entire dataset.
        * > This method distributes the load by horizontally splitting the data
        * > meaning each shard manages a different piece of the data.
            1. Horizontal data partitioning.
            2. Shards hosted on different servers.
            3. Independent scaling per shard.
            4. Shards can be geographically distributed. 
    - Advantages of Database Sharding
        * > Handles smaller data per shard, reducing query time.
        * > Easy horizontal scaling by adding more shards.
        * > Distributes traffic, preventing server bottlenecks.
    - Disadvantages of Database Sharding
        * > Adds complexity in setup and maintenance.
        * > Uneven data growth may require shard rebalancing.
        * > Cross-shard queries can be slow and complex.
2. `Database replication` 
    - improves read performance and fault tolerance, but can cause data inconsistency and increases storage requirements.
    - is the process of copying and maintaining database data across multiple servers or locations.
    - It ensures that there are multiple replicas of the same data.
        * which improves: 
            * > data availability
            * > fault tolerance
            * > redundancy
            * > can enhance read performance.
            1. Full data copies on multiple servers.
            2. Can be synchronous (immediate) or asynchronous (eventual).
            3. Enhances availability and disaster recovery.
            4. Supports read scaling and failover.
    - There are typically two main types of replication:
        1. `Master Slave Replication` (Primary-Replica):
            - One primary server handles all writes, while replicas sync data for read operations.
        2. `Master Master Replication` (Multi-Primary): 
            - Multiple servers handle both reads and writes with synchronized data across nodes.
    - Disadvantages of Database Replication
        * > Writes may not appear instantly on all replicas, causing inconsistencies.
        * > Requires more storage as each replica holds full data.
        * > Geographical replication can introduce synchronization latency.

    - Database Sharding vs. Database Replication

    |               Database Sharding                                               Database Replication                     | 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Divides data into smaller chunks (shards).                 |       Copies the same data to multiple servers.           |
    | It is used for Scalability and performance improvement.    |  It is used for High availability and redundancy.         |
    | Each shard contains a portion of the data.                 |     Each replica contains a full copy of the data.        |
    | Spreads data and queries across shards.                    |        Spreads read queries across replicas.              |
    | Cross-shard queries can complicate consistency.            | Can suffer from inconsistency due to lag between replicas.|
    | Low tolerance as failure of one shard affects part of data.| High tolerance, other replicas can take over if one fails.|
    |   Complex to implement and manage.                         | Simpler to implement but requires careful sync management.|
