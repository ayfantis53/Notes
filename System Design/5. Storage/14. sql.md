**14. SQL PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
1. SQL (Structured Query Language) 
    * > is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
    * > A relational database organizes data into tables with columns and rows, and SQL provides a way to interact with that data. 
    - Key concepts
        1. [Declarative-language]: 
            - With SQL, you describe the desired result you want to achieve rather than specifying the step-by-step process of how to get it. 
            - The Database Management System (DBMS) determines the most efficient way to execute the query.
        2. [Relational-Database-Management-System] (RDBMS): 
            - This is a server-side application that stores and manages data and implements the SQL standard. 
            - Examples include MySQL, Oracle SQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
        3. [Structured-data]: 
            - SQL is particularly useful for handling structured data.
            - which means data with predefined relationships and a tabular format. 
    - Common SQL commands
        * SQL commands can be broken down into two main categories: 
        1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
            - Used for interacting with the data within database tables
                * > `SELECT`     : Retrieves data from a database.
                * > `INSERT INTO`: Inserts new records into a table.
                * > `UPDATE`     : Modifies existing records in a table.
                * > `DELETE`     : Removes records from a table. 
        2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
            - Used for defining and modifying the structure of database objects: 
                * > `CREATE DATABASE` : Creates a new database.
                * > `CREATE TABLE`    : Creates a new table.
                * > `ALTER TABLE`     : Modifies the structure of an existing table.
                * > `DROP TABLE`      :  Deletes a table. 
    - Uses for SQL
        * [Data-analysis]: 
            * > Data analysts and data scientists use SQL to extract, filter, and aggregate data from large datasets.
        * [Application-backend]: 
            * > Software developers use SQL to build the backend of applications
            * > allowing them to store, retrieve, and manage user data.
        * [Business-intelligence]: 
            * > Companies use SQL databases to track performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
        * [Automating-tasks]: 
            * > Data professionals can use SQL to automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and auditability. 
    - Why is SQL so popular?
        * [Large-datasets]: 
            - SQL can manage and retrieve data from millions of rows much more efficiently than traditional spreadsheet tools like Excel.
        * > [Simplicity]: 
            - It uses straightforward, English-like syntax that is relatively easy to learn.
        * > [Standardized]: 
            - It is a standardized language used across most major RDBMS platforms, making the skills highly transferable.
        * > [Integrity-and-reliability]: 
            - The language is designed to ensure high data integrity, with infrastructure to back up, restore, and maintain data over long periods. 
2. SQL database
    * > is a type of relational database that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. 
    * > These databases are designed to store structured data in tables, where data is organized into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. 
    * > Each row represents a record or entity, and each column defines a specific attribute or field of that entity. 
    - Key characteristics and components of a SQL database include:
        1. [Relational-Model]: 
            - Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, and relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys. 
            - This structure ensures data integrity and consistency.
        2. [Structured-Query-Language](SQL): 
            - This is the standard language used to interact with the database. 
            - SQL allows users to perform various operations, including
                1. `Creating`: database objects (tables, views, indexes).
                2. `Reading` : or retrieving data (queries using `SELECT`).
                3. `Updating`: existing data (`UPDATE`).
                4. `Deleting`: data (`DELETE`).
        3. [Relational-Database-Management-System](RDBMS): 
            - This is the software system that manages and provides access to the SQL database. 
            - Popular RDBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
        4. [ACID-Properties]: typically adhere to the ACID properties which guarantee reliable transaction processing. 
            1. [Atomicity]
                - ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work.
                - means all operations within a transaction are successfully completed and committed to the database.
                - or if any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
                    * > and the database returns to its state before the transaction began.
                - There are no partial updates.
            2. [Consistency]
                - guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. 
                - means that any data written to the database must adhere to all defined rules and constraints.
                    * > such as data types, referential integrity, and unique constraints.
                - A transaction cannot violate these rules, and if it attempts to, it will be rolled back.
            3. [Isolation]
                - ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
                - Each transaction appears to execute in isolation, as if it were the only transaction running on the database.
                -  Changes made by one transaction are not visible to other transactions 
                    * > until the first transaction is successfully committed.
                    * > This prevents issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
            4. [Durability] 
                - guarantees that once a transaction has been successfully committed, its changes are permanently stored and will survive any subsequent system failures, 
                    * > such as power outages or crashes.
                - This is typically achieved through mechanisms like write-ahead logging, where committed changes are recorded in a persistent log before being written to the main data files.
