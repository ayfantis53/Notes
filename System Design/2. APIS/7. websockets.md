**7. WEBSOCKETS PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
* WebSockets are a computer communications protocol that provides a persistent, bidirectional communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection, allowing for full-duplex data exchange between a client and a server. 
    - This enables real-time applications like online gaming, chat, and live data updates, as the server can send information to the client without the client first requesting it. 
    - While highly efficient for real-time data, WebSockets require careful implementation to manage state, ensure security, and handle potential connection drops.
* How they work
    1. [Persistent-connection]:
        - After an initial handshake, the connection remains open for a two-way conversation, unlike the request-response model of traditional HTTP. 
    2. [Full-duplex-communication]:
        - Both the client and server can send messages to each other independently and simultaneously over the same connection. 
    3. [Low-protocol-overhead]: 
        - Once established, the connection has a low overhead for sending data frames back and forth. 
    4. [Data-framing]: 
        - Messages are sent in frames, which can be either text (UTF-8 encoded) or binary data. 
* Common use cases:
    1. [Real-time-gaming]: 
        - Synchronizing game state between multiple players for multiplayer experiences.
    2. [Chat-applications]: 
        - Creating features like live messaging, typing indicators, and online presence. 
    3. [Live-data-feeds]: 
        - Displaying live scores, financial updates, and other real-time information on a website or app. 
    4. [Collaborative-tools]: 
        - Enabling multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, such as in online editors or whiteboards. 
    5. [Real-time-maps]: 
        - Displaying live, moving location data on a map.
* Implementation and considerations
    1. [Stateful-connections]: 
        - Unlike stateless HTTP, WebSockets maintain a connection state for each client, which can increase memory usage. 
    2. [Security]: 
        - Secure connections (wss://) using SSL/TLS encryption are crucial to protect data privacy and integrity
        - especially against vulnerabilities like XSS. 
    3. [Scalability]: 
        - Implementing proper load balancing and resource management is necessary for scaling applications. 
    4. [Connection-management]: 
        - There are no built-in mechanisms for automatic reconnection if a connection is lost. 
        - Fallback options like HTTP streaming or long polling may be needed for environments where WebSockets aren't supported. 
    5. [Libraries]: 
        - Various libraries and frameworks are available to help developers build WebSocket servers and clients.
        - such as websockets for Python or options within AWS API Gateway.
