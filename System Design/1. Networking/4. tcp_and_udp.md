**4. TCP & UDP PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are core internet protocols for sending data
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
    - [Reliability]: 
        * > Highly reliable and ordered. 
    - [How-it-works]: 
        * > Establishes a connection with a three-way handshake before sending data
        * > checks for errors
        * > retransmits lost packets. 
    - [Best-for]: 
        * > Situations where data integrity is critical
        * > such as web browsing, file downloads, and secure data transfers. 
2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    - [Reliability]: 
        * > Unreliable and unordered. 
    - [How-it-works]: 
        * > Sends data packets without establishing a connection or checking if they are received. 
        * > It simply sends them and moves on. 
    - [Best-for]: 
        * > Real-time applications where speed is more important than perfect delivery.
        * > such as online gaming, live video/audio streaming, and VoIP. 
* Choosing between TCP and UDP
    - Choose TCP when you need to guarantee every packet arrives correctly, like downloading a file. 
    - Choose UDP when you need the fastest possible speed and can tolerate some packet loss, like playing an online video game. 
    - Some applications, like DNS, use both: UDP for speed and a fallback to TCP if the response is lost or if the data is larger than 512 bytes. 

**4. TCP & UDP PART 2**
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    - [Type-of-Service]:
        * > is a connection-oriented protocol.
        * > Connection orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.
    - [Reliability]:
        * > TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router.
    - [Error-checking-mechanism]:
        * > TCP provides extensive error-checking mechanisms. 
        * > It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.
    - [Acknowledgment]:
        * > An acknowledgment segment is present.
    - [Sequence]:
        * > Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
        * > this means that packets arrive in order at the receiver.
    - [Speed]:
        * > TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.
    - [Retransmission]:
        * > Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP.
    - [Header-Length]:
        * > TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header.
    - [Weight]:
        * > TCP is heavy-weight.
    - [Handshaking-Techniques]:
        * > Uses handshakes such as SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK.
    - [Broadcasting]:
        * > TCP doesn't support Broadcasting.
    - [Protocols]:
        * > TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPs , FTP , SMTP and Telnet.
    - [Stream-Type]:
        * > The TCP connection is a byte stream.
    - [Overhead]:
        * > Low but higher than UDP.
    - [Applications]:
        * > is primarily utilized in situations when a safe and trustworthy communication procedure is necessary.
        * > such as in email, on the web surfing, and in military services.
2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    - [Type-of-Service]:
        * > is the Datagram-oriented protocol.
        * > This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection.
        * > efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission.
    - [Reliability]:
        * > The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
    - [Error-checking-mechanism]:
        * > UDP has only the basic error-checking mechanism using checksums.
    - [Acknowledgment]:
        * > No acknowledgment segment.
    - [Sequence]:
        * > There is no sequencing of data in UDP.
        * > If the order is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.
    - [Speed]:
        * > UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP.
    - [Retransmission]:
        * > There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
    - [Header-Length]:
        * > UDP has an 8 bytes fixed-length header.
    - [Weight]:
        * > UDP is lightweight.
    - [Handshaking-Techniques]:
        * > It's a connectionless protocol i.e. No handshake.
    - [Broadcasting]:
        * > UDP supports Broadcasting.
    - [Protocols]:
        * > UDP is used by DNS , DHCP , TFTP, SNMP , RIP , and VoIP.
    - [Stream-Type]:
        * > UDP connection is a message stream.
    - [Overhead]:
        * > Very low.
    - [Applications]:
        * > used in situations where quick communication is necessary but where dependability is not a concern.
        * > such as VoIP, game streaming, video, and music streaming, etc.
