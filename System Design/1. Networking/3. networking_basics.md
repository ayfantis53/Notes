------------------------------------------------------------
1. Network
    - system of interconnected devices (nodes) that can communicate and share resources. 
        * data, files, and printers.
        * devices are connected by communication channels and governed by protocols.
        * which are sets of rules for data exchange, such as TCP/IP.
        * can vary in size and scope.
            * > a small Local Area Network (LAN) in a single building.
            * > a vast Wide Area Network (WAN) like the Internet.
    - 2 ways a computer can connect to a network
        1. Wired connection
            - Physical cable, like an Ethernet cable
                * > connect the computer to a router, switch, or modem. 
            -  Wired connections are generally faster and more reliable than wireless connections
                * > ideal for tasks that require high bandwidth and low latency. 
        2. Wireless connection
            - The computer connects to the network using Wi-Fi, which transmits data via radio waves. 
            -   This method is highly mobile and convenient, as it eliminates the need for cables. 
                * > standard for many modern devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones. 
2. Core Components and Concepts

        5. POP/IMAP (Post Office Protocol/Internet Message Access Protocol): 
            - Used for retrieving email from a mail server. 
        6. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): 
            - Used for managing and monitoring network devices. 
        7. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): 
            - Used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.
5. Network Types
    * The main types of networks are distinguished by their geographical size.
    * Based on geographical size
        1. Personal Area Network (PAN): 
            - Connects devices for one person in a very small area, such as a room. 
        2. Local Area Network (LAN): 
            - Connects computers and devices within a limited area like an office, home, or school.
            - Small office, Home office (SOHO)

    * Other common types
        1. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): 
            - A wireless network within a limited area, commonly known as Wi-Fi. 
        2. Virtual Private Network (VPN): 
            - Creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, like the internet. 
        3. Storage Area Network (SAN): 
            - A dedicated, high-speed network for connecting servers to storage devices. 
        4. Campus Area Network (CAN): 
            - Connects multiple LANs across a university or corporate campus. 
        5. Enterprise Private Network (EPN): 
            - A network built and owned by a company to connect its various offices. 

**3. NETWORKING BASICS PART 2**
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Network Basics
    * [Hosts]: is any device connected to a network that can send and receive data.
        -  A host can act as a server
            * > providing information, services, or applications to other hosts (clients) on the network.
            * > responds to request from client.
        -  A host can also act as a client
            * > requesting services or information from a server.
            * > initiate requests.
        -  Examples of hosts
            * > [Computers]:       Desktops, laptops, and mainframes.
            * > [Mobile-devices]:  Smartphones and tablets.
            * > [Servers]:         Web servers, email servers, and database servers.
            * > [Peripherals]:     Network printers, smart TVs, and speakers.
            * > [Cloud-resources]: Cloud servers are also considered hosts. 
        - [Server]: computers with software installed which responds to specific requests.
    * [IP-Addresses]: is the identity of each host.
        - functions like a digital address.
            * > An IP address is a series of numbers separated by periods, such as `192.168.1.1`
            * > When you access the internet, your device is assigned a public IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
            * > Your device sends a request to a server on the internet, and the server uses your IP address to send the information back to you. 
        - allowing data to be sent to and from the correct device on the internet or a local network.
        - similar to how a street address directs mail.
        - Types of IP addresses:
            1. [Public-IP]:  address is used for communication over the internet.
            2. [Private-IP]: address is used for devices within a local network (like your home Wi-Fi).
            3. [Static]:     A fixed and permanent address assigned to a device. 
                * > It is ideal for servers or applications that require a constant connection.     
            4. [Dynamic]:     A temporary address that is automatically assigned and can change each time the device connects to a network. 
                * > This is common for most home users. 
    * [Network]: what transports traffic between hosts.
        - Anytime two hosts are connected you have a network.
        - Networks can contain other networks within itself [SubNets].
        - Interconnected Networks [Internet].
2. Network Devices
    1. [Repeater]: receives a signal, amplifies it, and retransmits it to extend the range of a network.
        -  It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model, meaning it regenerates raw signals without interpreting the data they carry.
        - The purpose is to boost signal strength, improve coverage over larger distances, and overcome signal degradation.
        - though it also amplifies noise and cannot filter malicious traffic.  
        - How Repeaters work
            1. Receive and regenerate: 
                - A repeater receives an incoming signal and regenerates it to its original strength. 
            2. Re-transmit:  
                - It then retransmits the boosted signal to extend the network's reach.
            3. Physical layer operation: 
                - operates at the physical layer, it treats all data the same, whether it's valid or corrupted. 
                - doesn't understand or inspect data content, differing from more advanced devices like routers. 
            4. Connect segments: 
                - In wired networks, a two-port repeater can connect two cable segments together
                - but it does not extend the overall cable length limit. 
        - Advantages of using a repeater
            1. Increased coverage: 
                - Extends the physical and wireless range of a network. 
            2. Improved signal strength: 
                - Boosts the signal to provide a more stable connection over a longer distance. 
            3. Cost-effective: 
                - A simpler and often cheaper solution compared to setting up more complex equipment like routers.
        - Limitations of repeaters
            1. Amplifies noise: 
                - Since it doesn't filter data, it also amplifies any noise or interference that has accumulated along with the signal. 
            2. No security: 
                - Repeaters do not support encryption or security protocols. 
            3. Network congestion: 
                - By retransmitting every signal, including noise, they can contribute to network congestion.
                - do not reduce network traffic. 
            4. Inability to connect dissimilar networks: 
                - They cannot connect networks that use different designs or protocols.  
    2. [Hub]: a basic device that connects multiple computers or devices in a local area network (LAN)      
        - by receiving data on one port and broadcasting it to all other ports.
        - multi port repeater.
        - Hubs operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the network model.
        - are less efficient than modern switches because they broadcast all traffic.
        - leading to performance issues and collisions when multiple devices transmit at once.
        - They are now mostly replaced by network switches for their lack of intelligence, but were historically used for their low cost and simplicity.
        - How a hub works
            1. A hub acts as a central point for devices to connect to. 
            2. When a device sends data to the hub, the hub replicates and sends that data out to all other ports. 
            3. It has no intelligence, so it doesn't know the destination of the data and forwards it to every connected device. 
        - Advantages and disadvantages
            1. Advantages
                * > Simple and inexpensive. 
                * > Easy to set up. 
                * > Useful for connecting devices on a single network segment when a router doesn't have enough ports. 
            2. Disdvantages
                * > Inefficient: Broadcasting data to all ports creates unnecessary traffic. 
                * > Collisions: Devices can't transmit data at the same time, leading to data collisions and loss. 
                * > Less secure: All devices see all traffic, making it easier to eavesdrop on data. 
                * > Limited performance: Performance degrades as more devices are added due to broadcast storms. 
    3. [Bridge]: connects two or more network segments at the data link layer (Layer 2) to create a single, unified network.
        - It works by inspecting traffic, learning the MAC addresses of devices on each segment, and then filtering or forwarding data frames based on those addresses. 
        - This process reduces congestion, improves performance by minimizing unnecessary traffic, and expands the network's reach.
        - sit between hub-connected hosts.
        - How a network bridge works
            1. Traffic inspection: 
                - A bridge receives data frames and examines the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address. 
            2. Media Access Control (MAC) address table: 
                - It builds a table that maps MAC addresses to specific network segments by analyzing the source MAC addresses of incoming frames. 
            3. Filtering: 
                - If a frame's destination MAC address is on the same segment as its source, the bridge drops the frame to prevent unnecessary traffic. 
            4. Forwarding: 
                - If the destination is on a different segment.
                - the bridge forwards the frame only to that specific port.  
            5. Broadcasting: 
                - If the destination MAC address is unknown or a broadcast address
                - the bridge sends the frame to all segments except the one it came from. 
        - Key functions and benefits
            1. Traffic management: 
                - Reduces network congestion by filtering traffic and forwarding it only to its intended destination.  
            2. Performance improvement: 
             - Increases efficiency and speed by segmenting the network and reducing the size of collision domains. 
            3. Network extension: 
                - Connects different network segments, which can include extending the reach of a network or connecting different physical media (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi).  
            4. Transparency: 
                - Bridges are "transparent" to the end devices, meaning they operate without needing to be configured and devices are unaware of the bridge's presence.  

    4. [Switch]: device that connects multiple devices, and facilitates comms within a network.
        - intelligently forwards data packets only to the intended destination.  
        - facilitates communication within a network. 
        - How it works
            1. Connects devices: 
                - A switch has multiple ports
                - each device on the network is plugged into one of these ports.
                - often via an Ethernet cable. 
            2. Learns Media Access Control (MAC) addresses:
                - When a data packet arrives.
                - the switch reads the source MAC address and records which port it came from in its MAC address table. 
            3. Forwards data: 
                - When a new packet arrives, the switch reads the destination Media Access Control(MAC) address. 
                - It then looks up that address in its table to determine the correct port and forwards the packet only to that specific port, rather than broadcasting it to all ports like a hub would.  
            4. Handles unknown addresses: 
                - If the switch does not have the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address in its table. 
                - It will temporarily forward the packet to all ports.
                -  when the destination device responds, the switch will add the destination's MAC address to its table. 
        - Key Function
            * > If the switch does not have the destination MAC address in its table, it will temporarily forward the packet to all ports, and when the destination device responds, the switch will add the destination's MAC address to its table. 
    5. [Router]: device that connects different local area networks (LANs), facilitates comms between networks.
        - directs data packets between them to their destinations.
        -  It acts as a gateway, determining the most efficient path for data to travel across a network, whether it's a home Wi-Fi network or the larger internet. 
            * > provide traffic control points between networks.
            * > provide logic location to apply security policies.
            * > they learn what network they are attached to, known as routes.
        - Routers use internal routing tables to guide packets to the correct IP address and manage traffic within the network.
        - [Routing-table]: all network a router knows about.
            * > closest router IP address.
        - [Gateway]: a hosts way out of their local network.
            * > Default Gateway    
        - Key functions of a router:
            1. Connects networks: 
                - A router's primary function is to link multiple networks together. For example, it connects your home network to your internet service provider's network.  
            2. Directs data traffic: 
                - It examines the IP address on data packets and uses its internal routing table to send them along the most efficient path to their destination.  
            3. Creates a local network: 
                - Routers allow multiple devices within a single location, like a home or office, to connect to each other and to the internet, forming a Local Area Network (LAN). 
            4. Manages local and remote connections: 
                - Routers handle both internal traffic between devices on a local network and external traffic between a local network and other networks, such as the internet.  
            5. Provides security and management: 
                - Routers often include features like a firewall to protect the network from unauthorized access and allow for user-controlled settings such as guest networks and parental controls. 
            6. Supports wireless connections: 
                - Wireless routers broadcast a Wi-Fi signal, allowing devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to connect to the network without cables.
        - Router vs. modem
            * A modem brings the internet connection from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) into your home. 
            * A router then takes that single internet connection and distributes it to multiple devices in your home, often wirelessly.
