## 10. CACHING PART 1

### Caching 
- is the process of storing copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary, high-speed location to speed up future requests. 
- It works by checking the cache first before accessing the slower, original data source, which reduces latency and decreases the load on the original system. 
- When the data is found in the cache, it's a `cache hit` and is served immediately. If the data is not in the cache, it's a `cache miss` and the system retrieves it from the original source, stores a copy in the cache, and then serves it.
### How caching works
1. **Check the cache first**:
    - When a request is made, the system first looks for the data in the cache. 
2. **Cache hit**:
    - If the data is in the cache, it is retrieved quickly, and the process is complete.
3. **Cache miss**: 
    - If the data is not in the cache, the system fetches it from the original data source, like a database. 
4. **Store and serve**: 
    - The system then stores a copy of this new data in the cache before sending it to the user, making it available for future requests.
### Key concepts
1. **Cache hit**: 
    - The requested data is found in the cache. 
2. **Cache miss**: 
    - The requested data is not in the cache and must be retrieved from the original source.
3. **Eviction policy**: 
    - When a cache is full, a strategy is needed to remove old data to make room for new data. 
    - Common policies include `Least Recently Used` (LRU), `First In First Out` (FIFO), and `Least Frequently Used` (LFU). 
4. **Synchronization**: 
    - Caches need to be kept consistent with the original data source to avoid serving stale information.
### Types of caching
1. **Client side caching**: 
    - A web browser stores data like images and scripts on a user's device to load pages faster on subsequent visits. 
2. **Hardware caching**: 
    - CPUs use small, fast caches (`L1`, `L2`, `L3`) to store frequently used data and instructions, significantly speeding up processing. 
3. **Server side caching**: 
    - Caches are placed between the application and the data source to store the results of database queries or other computations.
