**11. CDNs PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
- A CDN, or Content Delivery Network
    * > is a geographically distributed network of servers that delivers web content faster by caching it on servers closer to the user. This reduces latency and improves website performance, security, and reliability by routing users to the nearest server for a faster experience.
- How it works
    1. [Content-distribution]: 
        - A CDN stores copies of a website's static content, such as images, videos, and CSS files, on a global network of servers called edge servers.
    2. [Proximity-to-users]: 
        - These edge servers are located in different geographic regions, forming Points of Presence (PoPs). 
    3. [Routing-requests]: 
        - When a user requests content, the CDN directs them to the edge server physically closest to them, which can deliver the content much faster than the origin server located far away.
    4. [Caching]: 
        - By storing content in its cache on these edge servers, a CDN can serve it directly to users without having to retrieve it from the origin server every time.  
- Benefits of using a CDN
    1. [Faster-load-times]: 
        - Delivering content from a nearby server significantly reduces the time it takes for a webpage to load.
    2. [Improved-reliability]: 
        - A distributed network is more resilient to traffic spikes or server outages. 
    3. [Enhanced-security]: 
        - CDNs can help protect against attacks by absorbing traffic and providing a layer of security at the edge.
    4. [Reduced-costs]: 
        - By offloading requests from the origin server, a CDN can lower data transfer costs.
