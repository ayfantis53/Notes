**0. COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE PART 1**
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Storage
    - Disk (Storage)
        * Types
            >* Hard Disk Drive
            >* Solid State Drive
        * Store all of our data persistenlty
            >* Even if computer shuts off our data will not be lost.
            >* size in TB usually
        * How much data we can store is measured on 100s GB or terrabytes
            >* 1 byte is 8 bits.
            >* each bit can store a 0 or a 1.
            >* 1 TB is 10^12 which is a trillion bits.
    - Random Access Memory (RAM)
        * smaller than disc can be 32 GB.
        * RAM more expensive.
        * More efficient. Microseconds (1 milionth of second).
            >* reading from disc measure in micro seconds which is 10^3 (1 ten thousandth of second).
        * Not persistent. 
    - CPU
        * lets RAM and Disk talk.
        * brain of computer.
        * Read and write from RAM and disk.
        * CPU reads our code to execute code from RAM.
            >* ram has data portion where we store our variables from our code.
        * All computations are done in the CPU.
    - Cache
        * memory that belongs to a CPU 
            >* storage size in MB
        * used to speed up read and write operations from RAM.
            >* on scale of nanoseconds (10^-9 or 1 billionth of a second).
        * mainly used as substitute fro RAM.
        * improves performance but is expensive.
        * Not persistent.
2. Moore's Law
    - Over time the number of transistors in a CPU doubles every two years.
    - and the cost is cut in half every 2 years.
