## BINARY TREE
### A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes
* where each node has at most two children.
* referred to as the left child and the right child. 
* The topmost node in the tree is called the root. 
* Nodes without any children are known as leaf nodes. 

### Key characteristics of binary trees:
1. **Nodes**: 
    - Each node typically contains a value or data element, along with pointers (or references) to its left and right children.
2. **Roo**`: 
    - The starting point of the tree.
3. **Children**: 
    - Each node can have zero, one, or two children.
4. **Leaves**: 
    - Nodes that do not have any children.
5. **Edges**: 
    - The links connecting a parent node to its child nodes.

### Types of Binary Trees:
1. **Full Binary Tree**:
    - Every non-leaf node has exactly two children.
2. **Complete Binary Tree**:
    - All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. 
3. **Perfect Binary Tree**:
    - Every level is completely filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same depth. 
4. **Balanced Binary Tree**:
    - The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. This helps ensure efficient operations.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
    - A specialized binary tree where for every node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value
    - all values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value. 
    - This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Common operations on Binary Trees:
1. **Traversal**: 
    - Visiting each node in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
2. **Insertion**: 
    - Adding a new node to the tree.
3. **Deletion**: 
    - Removing a node from the tree.
4. **Search**: 
    - Finding a specific node within the tree.
